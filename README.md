# JournalApp

JournalApp is a scalable and secure web application designed to help me to create, manage, and organize their personal journal entries efficiently. The project showcases modern software development practices by integrating robust backend architecture with advanced features such as messaging, security, caching, and cloud deployment.

## Features

- Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for journal entries
- User authentication and authorization using OAuth2 protocol
- Real-time data processing with distributed messaging system
- Caching of frequently accessed data for optimal performance
- Deployment-ready configuration for cloud platforms
- Data validation and consistent error handling
- Environment-based configuration for flexibility and scalability

## Technology Stack

- **Java (JDK 17+)**: Core programming language
- **Backend Framework**: Modular framework with dependency injection and layered architecture
- **Web Framework (MVC)**: For clean separation of concerns and UI rendering
- **OAuth2**: Secure authentication and authorization framework
- **Apache Kafka**: Distributed event streaming platform for asynchronous processing and messaging
- **Redis & Redis Cloud**: In-memory data store and caching solution to improve application responsiveness
- **Relational Database**: SQL database such as PostgreSQL or H2 embedded DB
- **Build Tools**: Maven or Gradle for build automation and dependency management
- **Cloud Deployment**: Platform as a Service (PaaS) deployment using Heroku
- **Validation**: Annotation-driven input validation for reliable data entry
- **Logging**: SLF4J/Logback for application monitoring and debugging
- **Testing**: Unit and integration testing frameworks
- **Front-end**: Basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for UI, optionally enhanced with modern libraries

## Project Structure

- **src/main/java**: Source code including controllers, services, repositories, entities, configurations
- **src/main/resources**: Templates, static assets, and configuration files
- **pom.xml / build.gradle**: Project metadata and dependencies

## Learning Outcomes

- Implementing OAuth2 security for modern authentication flows
- Integrating Kafka for event-driven architectures and asynchronous messaging
- Leveraging Redis caching to boost performance and scalability
- Deploying applications to cloud platforms like Heroku with smooth configuration management
- Applying robust validation and logging strategies
- Designing modular, maintainable, and scalable Java-based web applications

## Future Enhancements

- Add richer client-side UI with real-time features using WebSocket
- Implement API gateway and microservices architecture
- Introduce comprehensive monitoring and alerting with external tools
- Expand OAuth2 features with multi-factor authentication support
